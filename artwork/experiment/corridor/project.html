<span class="hilink">"THE CORRIDOR"</span> is a meditative experience, presented as an interactive visual poetry. It was created by a group of artists, filmmakers and multimedia creatives. <span class="hilink">"THE CORRIDOR"</span> involves several experiments. On the artistic side, it aims to analyze the relationship between interactivity and circular narrative structure by developing a 3 dimensional set of dead-end corridor, in which the screen content is unfolded through visitors footsteps. On the technical side, we explore the sensitivity of the touch-based sensor in relation to specific gestures used in daily life. After all, <span class="hilink">"THE CORRIDOR"</span> tells a heartbroken story about our home, Hong Kong.
