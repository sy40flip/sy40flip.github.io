<span class="hilink"><a href="project.html">"THE CORRIDOR"</a></span> project was self-funded, and shown as a pilot project in the exhibition. It was held on July 8-10, 2016 at the Dreamlike Bubble Gallery. We aim to make it as a first attempt to find out the hidden technical problems, and discover a better way to deliver artist's ideas in this interactive form.
