info=<textformat leading="7"><br><br><b><u>What is 'soblind':</b></u><br><br>We are all too comfortable with ourselves and our habits. We tend to reject anything or anyone that disturbs our comfort zone. However sometimes, out of nowhere, a force or a fate constantly pushes us to keep contact with these things or people that we do not like.<br><br>In 'soblind', a character who is blind wants to reach the end of a journey following a path. He is moving forward as a habit while the end is not on the path. What remains on the journey is a loop.<br><br>You, the audience, at the same time, the user, act as an external force in this situation, who has to drag the little character icon on the track away from his path, in order to trigger a story to develop inside the core, which will finally make the whole experience come to an end.
