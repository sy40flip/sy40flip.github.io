He then said to the fortune teller taking him as an incarnated fairy, 'Master, you are really fantastic! Yes, my path of life has been rough and rugged since my birth and I shall reach the age of 40 in a few days time. What about my fate after 40?' <br><br>He anticipated an answer from the fortune teller, full of expectations. <br><br>'After 40?' said the fortune teller, 'You will still be poor.'<br><br>'But why?' the man asked with perplexity.<br><br>'Because you have got used to it!' said the fortune teller.
