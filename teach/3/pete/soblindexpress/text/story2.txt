The caterpillars then proceeded along like a circular parade without ending. <br><br>Other observers put some food by the side of the path of parade, expecting the caterpillars would soon disband the parade when they needed food and felt fed up with the meaningless crawling.<br><br>Unexpectedly, the caterpillars did not stop but continued to crawl along the edge of the flower pot at the same speed for seven days and nights until each and every one of them starved to death.
