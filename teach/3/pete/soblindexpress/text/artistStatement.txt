info=<textformat leading="10"><b>ARTIST STATEMENT (EXCERPT)</b><br>"soblind" is an experiment on story experience in an age when internet experience connects with movie-watching experience. We are so used to see drama move the story forward within time. I wish to experiment on "what makes a story move forward", what if we take out the factor "time", but replace it with "audience participation". Therefore, if audiences act on the story a bit, the story reveals a bit. If audiences act on the story throughout, the story system will respond and advances the plot to the end. Otherwise, if audiences do not move at all, the story does not develop but stays. This is when "soblind" becomes a time-based artwork that acts as a meditation on the misunderstanding among our neighbours in everyday life.
