A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/drawerB/pen/WKzvxB.

 A variation on a little sequence using waypoints.js and skrollr.js to change Alice's "attitude" as you make her "fall" down the rabbit hole with scrolling and making Tuna fly up.

I did all the art. You can read the full version here: http://rachelnabors.com/alice-in-videoland/book 

At the very end are links to the github repo + 2 tutorial articles I wrote about how I did it.

Forked from [Rachel Nabors](http://codepen.io/rachelnabors/)'s Pen [Tuna and Alice](http://codepen.io/rachelnabors/pen/lqhyE/).
