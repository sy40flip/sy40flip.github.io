<h2>
about the art group
</h2>
<p id="artGroup">
We are a newly established art society, <span class="hilinkEdi"><a href="artwork/experiment/corridor/artGroup.html">Edison Vibe</a></span>. We are a group of local multimedia creative who come from various background, including filmmaking, interior design, graphic design and computer science. We have our separate focus, but at the same time, we treasure communication when opportunity comes. We hope to explore different possibilities of how to connect public with art-and-design. One of our major creations will be interactive screenworks.
</p>

<p id="meaning">
The art society is called <span class="hilinkEdi"><a href="artwork/experiment/corridor/artGroup.html">Edison Vibe</a></span>. Edison refers to Thomas Edison. We look up to Edison's experimental spirit, his persistence and dedication to his work. We also look back to the root of this spirit, as Edison's mother is a great educator who encourages his son to fight through adversity during his childhood and downtime.
We want this spirit of making experimental screenwork to be like a vibe. This vibe gathers artists and technologists to move forward to make artworks that sing.
